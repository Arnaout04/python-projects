#Python Basics
print('Hello World!')

#Variables
x = 5
y = "Hello, my name is Slim Shady"
z = 13.6
g = True

#To print variables is simple

print(x)
print(y, "\n")
print(z, "\n")
print(g, "\n")

#You can also specify

t = float(5)

#Can also acquire data type through type()

print(type(t))

#Single or double quotes are the same in python

print('Hello')
print("Heya")

#Assigning multiple variables in single line

h, l, p = 4 , 6 , 9

ten = nine = seven = 'number'

#Unpacking array

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

one, two, three = fruits

#print variable styles

print(one, two, three)

print(one + two + three)

#For numbers plus becomes addition

print(h + p)
